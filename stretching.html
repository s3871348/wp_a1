    <h2>Stretching safely</h2>
    <blockquote> It's helpful to include stretching in your exercise regimen. Stretching can increase flexibility and
        improve your
        joints' range of motion, helping you move more freely. And ensuring that you have equal flexibility on both
        sides might help protect you from injury.

        Before stretching, warm up with five to 10 minutes of light activity. Better yet, stretch after a workout. Keep
        stretches gentle and slow. Don't bounce. Breathe through your stretches. If you feel pain, you've stretched too
        far.

        Hold a stretch for about 30 seconds, to the point of a slight pull, on each side. Repeat the stretch on both
        sides two to four times. Stretching is recommended two to three days a week.

        If you have health conditions or injuries, talk to your doctor or physical therapist about which stretches are
        right for you.
