            <h2>About Well-being</h2>
            <blockquote>Wellbeing is not just the absence of disease or illness. It’s a complex combination of a
                person's
                physical, mental, emotional and social health factors.
                Wellbeing is strongly linked to happiness and life satisfaction. In short, wellbeing could be described
                as how you feel about yourself and your life. </blockquote>
            <h2>Factors that influence wellbeing</h2>
            <blockquote>
                Every aspect of your life influences your state of wellbeing. Researchers investigating happiness have
                found the following factors enhance a person's wellbeing:
                <ul>
                    <li>Happy intimate relationship with a partner.</li>
                    <li>Regular exercise.</li>
                    <li>Nutritional diet.</li>
                    <li>Enough sleep.</li>
                    <li>Fun hobbies and leisure pursuits.</li>
                    <li>Optimistic outlook.</li>
                    <li>Sense of purpose and meaning.</li>
                    <li>The ability to adapt to change.</li>
                </ul>
                Considering the factors above that affect wellbeing, we have prepared 4 services for you to use: Yoga,
                Meditation, Stretching and Healthy habits. Below, there are a small description about what these
                services provide you and what you an expect from them. You can watch the videos and read the
                descriptions. But to be able to fully benefit from these services you need to register to LIFE website
                with the link above.

                <blockquote>Stretching is a form of physical exercise in which a specific muscle or tendon (or muscle
                    group)
                    is deliberately flexed or stretched in order to improve the muscle's felt elasticity and achieve

                    can and as long as they live. This is how we can be happier. With the LIFE's Healthy Habits service,
