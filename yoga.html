    <blockquote>Yoga is an ancient set of beliefs in the Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain traditions that strives towards
        spiritual discipline. In the West, yoga is less understood for its spiritual component and more commonly
        known as a physical workout of specific poses, or asanas. It's actually not just something you "do" but
        something that you practice to strengthen, relax, and energize your body and mind. Any person can practice yoga,
        from Asana practice to meditation and breathing.
        <h2>Getting Started with Yoga</h2>
        Warm up with sun salutation. Yoga can be quite active, so it is important to warm up your body properly. Doing a
        few rounds of sun salutations, or Surya Namaskar, can effectively prepare your muscles and mind to practice
        yoga.
        There are three different variations of sun salutations. Do 2-3 rounds of Surya Namaskar A, B, and C to warm up.
        These different sun salutations can engage and condition your muscles and can help ensure a safe and more
        pliable practice.
        Flow classes will often start with a sun salutation warm-up. Practicing these at home may help you feel more
        comfortable for when you decide to join a class.
        <h2>Focus on your breathing.</h2>
        Yogic breathing, or pranayama, is one of the core skills of any yoga practice. Focusing on your breathing can
        deepen your asana practice, tune you into your own body, and allows you to relax.
        Pranayama can help your body distribute oxygen to its different parts. The goal is to breath deeply by inhaling
        and exhaling completely and in a balanced manner through your nose. For example, you would inhale for 4 breaths,
        hold for 2 counts, and then exhale completely for four breaths. You can vary the counts according to your
        abilities.
        If you want to get the most out of your yogic breathing, so sit upright, with your shoulders back to allow for
        the full capacity of breath. Breathe slowly and evenly by focusing from your stomach, pulling in your belly to
        expand your lungs and rib cage.
        You can also try Ujjayi breathing, which can help you flow through your practice more effectively. You do Ujjayi
        breathing by inhaling and exhaling evenly through your nose and making a slight sound like the sea when you
        breathe.
