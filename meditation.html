        <h2>What is meditation?</h2>
        <p>Meditation is a type of mind–body or relaxation therapy.

            During meditation, you concentrate your mind on one particular thing, such as your breathing, sounds, body
            movements and feelings or a mantra (chant).

            This helps train your mind to stay focused and peaceful during times of stress or anxiousness.</p>
        <h2>What are the health benefits of meditation?</h2>
        <p>Meditation has both physical and mental health benefits. It can help you manage the symptoms of many health
            conditions, including:
        <ol>
            <li>anxiety</li>
